        ========
        
        Description
        -----------
        **dirshare** is a HTTP WSGI Python application to rapidly share images within 
        a specific root path, leverages thumbnail caching, instantaneous image 
        resizing, file meta data extraction and zip file creation.
        
        The motivation to create this application is that occasionally I must browse a 
        large collection of photos, WITHOUT a dedicated server software, loading of 
        full sized images or modifying original files.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        - Setuptools (for installing dirshare and its Python dependencies)
        - (optional) Access to a mongo database server
        
        **Note** Pillow library uses system libraries to decode specific type of files.
        If you get "IOError: decoder XXX not available" while loading some images, 
        you're probably missing some libraries (ex. libjpeg).
        
        Installation
        ------------
        From PyPI:
        > pip install dirshare
        
        Or:
        > python setup.py install
        
        
        Configuration and usage
        -----------------------
        1) Generate a .ini file:
        > dirshare -e <output.ini>
        
        2) Edit generated file and configured as needed (specially _images\_root_ 
        and mongo server settings). Most of the settings are self explanatory.
        
        3) Launch server:
        > dirshare -c <output.ini>
        
        4) Point a browser to dirshare's port (default 6543).
        
        * _images\_per\_page_ is the maximum number images to display per page. 
        This parameter can be overwritten in HTTP request, with 'pp' GET parameter.
        * _image\_sizes_ is a space separated list of (re)sizes available in a form 
        of MAX\_WIDTHxMAX\_HEIGHT. The image is resized to these values, with its 
        aspect ratio preserved. The first element in _image\_sizes_ is the thumbnail 
        size. Keyword _full_ is the original image.
        * _resize\_format_ is the encoder to use in image resizes.
        * _resize\_quality_ is the quality parameter used by image encoder.
