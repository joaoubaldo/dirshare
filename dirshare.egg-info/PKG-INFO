        ========
        
        Description
        -----------
        **dirshare** is a HTTP WSGI Python application to rapidly share images within 
        a specific root path, leverages thumbnail caching, instantaneous image 
        resizing, file meta data extraction and zip file creation.
        
        The motivation to create this application is that occasionally I must browse a 
        large collection of photos, WITHOUT a dedicated server software, loading of 
        full sized images or modifying original files.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        - Setuptools (for installing dirshare and its Python dependencies)
        - (optional) Access to a mongo database server
        
        **Note** Pillow library uses system libraries to decode specific type of files.
        If you get "IOError: decoder XXX not available" while loading some images, 
        you're probably missing some libraries (ex. libjpeg).
        
        Installation
        ------------
        From PyPI:
        > pip install dirshare
        
        Or:
        > python setup.py install
